Limp Bizkit - Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
to be the bad man,
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
to be hated,
to be fated
to telling only lies...

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be...
I have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free...

No one knows what it's like
to feel there feelings
like I do
and I blame you.
No one bites back as hard on their anger
none of my rain and woes
can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be...
I have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free...

No one knows what it's like
to be mistreated
to be defeated
behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say
that they're sorry
and don't worry
I'm not telling lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be...
I have hours, only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free...

No one knows what it's like
to be the bad man,
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes...
